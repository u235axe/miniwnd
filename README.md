# miniwnd
Minimal windowing for C++.

## Intentions
This small framework is targeting use-cases where a simple, light-weight windowing is needed into a modern C++ project or where flexibility is required for low-level access to the native variables, e.g. when initializing a complex API interplay (openGL-openCL interop).
Mainly teaching, scientific and debugging cases are considered. It is not meant to replace existing large windowing libraries like [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org), [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org), [Qt](https://www.qt.io).
